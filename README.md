# Particles
Particles is a simple particle life simulator. Thats it.  
Current version is v1.1.8.

v1.1.8:
- Migrated from localStorage to computer storage for extra space
- Now creates a directory called "particles" in home directory

## Build Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/Muhtasim-Rasheed/particles
cd particles
npm install
npm run package
```
Then you should have 3 folders:  
`./particles-darwin-x64/`  
`./particles-linux-x64/`  
`./particles-win32-x64/`  
  
Then you can do anything you want with the build  
files. For MacOS you may copy-paste the application  
to /Applications or similar things on other  
platforms (I don't know how to do it on other  
platforms)
