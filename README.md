# Particles
Particles is a simple particle life simulator. Thats it.  
Current version is v1.1.3.

## Build Instructions
```
$ npm install
$ npm run package
```
Then you should have 3 folders:  
`./particles-darwin-x64/`  
`./particles-linux-x64/`  
`./particles-win32-x64/`  
  
Then you can do anything you want with the build  
files. For MacOS you may copy-paste the application  
to /Applications or similar things on other  
platforms (I don't know how to do it on other  
platforms)
